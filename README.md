# Microsoft Application Insights JavaScript SDK for Dart

A Dart wrapper for the [Microsoft Application Insights JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-JS). 

**NOTE:** This package is a work in progress and is subject to change before the first stable release!

## Getting Started

### 1. Adding ai.js
Before this package can be used, ai.js must be referenced along-side your Dart application.

Each release of this package comes with the latest compatible ai.js version. We highly recommend using the version bundled with this package (ai.js is not modified in any way. We just bundle the release we are targeting).

```html
<script src="packages/application_insights_js/ai.min.js"></script>
```

Currently, only the minified version of ai.js is bundled.

### 2. Usage

Coming soon!
